# A RAMP starting kit for French novelists identification

*Authors : Romain Avouac, Jaime Costa Centena, Adrien Danel, Guillaume Desforges, Jos√©-Louis Imbert, Slimane Thabet*

The goal of this challenge is to classify 19th century French writers based on their small portions of their work. This has exciting applications, from identifying unknown texts to linking writers with one another!
