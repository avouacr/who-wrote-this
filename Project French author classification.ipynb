    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorship identification is the task of recognizing who the author of a document is.\n",
    "It is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) kind of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to identify the author of a document presents several applications, such as detecting plagiarism or finding the author of an anonymous document.\n",
    "Archives all around the world are full of documents for which knowing the author would be invaluable knowledge for historical studies.\n",
    "Furthermore, [the multiple plagiarism scandals](https://lithub.com/12-literary-plagiarism-scandals-ranked/) in literature could be solved with an algorithm.\n",
    "For instance the authorship of Moliere or Shakespeare has been debated from the 19th century (more on this [here](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternit%C3%A9_des_%C5%93uvres_de_Moli%C3%A8re) and [here](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternit%C3%A9_des_%C5%93uvres_de_Shakespeare)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This task has also an instructive purpose.\n",
    "It is a way to investigate if NLP algorithms are able to capture bot only the semantics, but also the literary style of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric of the competition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to predict the author of a given piece of litterature from a given set of authors.\n",
    "In machine learning, this type of problem is called \"multiclass classification\" problem, that is for each item we predict the class that it belongs to.\n",
    "Here, the items are the documents (one or more paragraphs) and the classes are the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the performance of an algorithm solving this type of problems, one could propose the *precision* of the algorithm.\n",
    "The precision of an algorithm in the prediction of a given class is defined as the number of right predictions on that class divided by the number of items where the algorithm predicted it.\n",
    "Then we could compute for instance the mean precision of the algorithm on all the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, one could say that the *recall* of the algorithm is also important, or its *accuracy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, an algorithm can be tweaked to offer a better precision or a better recall, but not both at the same time - there is no free lunch.\n",
    "There is a tradeoff to be made, usually depending on the application domain.\n",
    "For example, in a medical team you would want as little false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the model, we propose to use the ROC AUC metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO** continuer en présentant la ROC AUC.\n",
    "\n",
